# Project-Testing-Practice

Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!

1. A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

2. A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

3. A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
